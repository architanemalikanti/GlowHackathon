## Setup Instructions üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS development)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- OpenAI API key
- iOS device or simulator

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd GlowGirl/Backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the Backend directory:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

5. **Run the backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5001`

### iOS App Setup

1. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open GlowGirl.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Update API endpoints:**
   In `APIServices.swift`, ensure the backend URL matches your setup:
   ```swift
   private let baseURL = "http://localhost:5001"
   ```

3. **Add your OpenAI API key:**
   In `APIServices.swift`, replace the API key with your own.

4. **Build and run:**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press Cmd+R to build and run

## How It Works üîß

### 1. Vector Embedding Logic
```python
def create_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=text,
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']
```
- Converts user's vent text to high-dimensional vectors
- Stores in database with metadata (mood, vibe, date)
- Enables semantic search for similar past situations
- Improves recommendations over time based on patterns

### 2. Speech-to-Text Logic
```swift
private func startRecording() {
    let speechRecognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"))
    let recognitionRequest = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
    
    // Configure audio input and start recognition
    recognitionTask = speechRecognizer.recognitionTask(with: recognitionRequest) { result, error in
        if let result = result {
            transcribedText = result.bestTranscription.formattedString
        }
    }
}
```
- Uses iOS Speech framework for real-time transcription
- Configures audio session for optimal recording
- Provides live feedback as user speaks
- Handles permissions and error states

### 3. Web Scraping Logic
```python
def scrape_beauty_products(mood, vibe, color_palette, style):
    search_terms = []
    
    if "heartbroken" in mood.lower() or "revenge" in vibe.lower():
        search_terms.extend(["red lipstick", "bold eyeliner", "black dress"])
    elif "excited" in mood.lower() or "new" in vibe.lower():
        search_terms.extend(["pink blush", "coral lipstick", "flowy dress"])
    
    # Filter products based on search terms
    # Return personalized recommendations with reasoning
```
- Analyzes mood and vibe to determine search terms
- Scrapes from beauty retailers (Sephora, Ulta, etc.)
- Filters products based on emotional context
- Provides personalized reasoning for each recommendation
